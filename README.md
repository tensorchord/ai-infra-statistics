## Why don't you collect statistics about X?

We are happy to collect statistics about other AI Infrastructure projects. Please open an issue or a pull request.

## Why don't you collect GitHub stars?

First, there are many products that are not open source. Second, GitHub stars are not a good indicator of popularity. Please let us know if you have any suggestions for other metrics.

## How do you collect the statistics?

We use the following tools:

- pypistats
- DockerHub API
